   <h1>Article [NEXT.JS VS REACT.JS]</h1>
</div>
   <br>
   <h2>Overview</h2>
   <br>
   <p>This article explains why Next.js is often a better choice than React.js. While React.js is great for building user interfaces, Next.js adds extra features like server-side rendering and static site generation. These features make websites faster, improve SEO, and simplify development, making Next.js more suitable for modern web applications.
   </p>
   <br>
   <h3>Object:</h3>
   <br>
   <p>This article aims to compare Next.js and React.js, showcasing why Next.js is often a better choice for web development due to its advanced features and performance benefits.
   </p>
   <br>
   <h4>WHAT IS REACT.JS?</h4>
   <br>
   <p>React.js is a well-liked JavaScript toolkit for creating user interfaces, especially for single-page apps that require a quick and engaging user experience. React, which is developed and maintained by Facebook, enables developers to easily manage the state of reusable user interface components.</p>
   <br>
   <h4> Components of React.js:</h4>
   <br>
   <h4>Functional component</h4>
   <br>
   <p>Simple functions that return a piece of UI (User Interface) written in JSX (a syntax extension for JavaScript).</p> 
   <br>
   <h4>Class Components</h4>
   <br>
   <p>More complex components defined using ES6 class syntax. They extend React Component and can have their own state and lifecycle methods.</p>

   <br>
   <br>
   <h1>WHAT IS NEXT.JS?</h1>
   <br>
   <p>Next.js is a React-based framework that includes tools and functionality for efficiently developing online applications.</p>
   <br>
   <h2>WHICH IS BETTER? {NEXT.JS VS REACT.JS}</h2>
   <br>
   <p>Choosing between React.js and Next.js depends on your specific needs and project requirements.
   <br>
   <br>
    While React.js has been a dominant library for building user interfaces but now it is currently facing a decline as newer technologies and frameworks, like Next.js, gain traction for their integrated solutions and superior performance. This shift reflects the evolving landscape of web development and the growing demand for more efficient tools.</p>
   <br>
   <br>
   <h2>THE NEXT.JS</h2>
   <br>
   <p>At this time, Next.js is rapidly becoming a leading framework due to its strong performance with server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), built-in features, and smooth developer experience. Its growing adoption reflects its ability to handle complex web applications efficiently.</p>
   <br>
   <br>
   <p>As Next.js is becoming popular framework for building web applications with React. </p>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <br>
   <p>In conclusion, while React.js remains a powerful tool for building user interfaces, Next.js is becoming the preferred choice in the industry due to its performance enhancements, built-in features, and improved developer experience.</p>
